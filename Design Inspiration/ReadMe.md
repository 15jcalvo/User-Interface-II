Once your repository is set up, practice what you learned today to create a portfolio site from the wireframe of your chosing. Your complete project should look similar to the wireframe you chose, including all of the following elements:

- [ ]  A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` pages
- [ ]  Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/200/300, or you may use images that mean something to you.
- [ ]  Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [ ]  A `My Projects` button (doesn't need to be functional)
- [ ]  A `Contact Me` button (doesn't need to be functional)
