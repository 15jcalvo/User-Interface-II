# Flexbox Module Challenge
The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## User Interface and Git

## User Interface II

## Objectives

- implement a CSS reset and understand why itâ€™s important for cross-browser development
- use CSS display properties to build user interface
- identify and explain all properties in the box model
- describe and understand that flexbox is a module
- demonstrate understanding of flex container properties in flex box

## Introduction

In this challenge you will be building a simple portfolio website based off of a wireframe of your chosing using the CSS principles covered today.

Portfolio websites are a great way to show off your work to friends, family, and future employers. As you progress through Lambda you can update this site with projects you're proud of. Similarly, you can change the style, add a blog page, the possibilites are really endless. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.
 

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Once your repository is set up, practice what you learned today to create a portfolio site from the wireframe of your chosing. Your complete project should look similar to the wireframe you chose, including all of the following elements:

- [ ]  A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` pages
- [ ]  Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/200/300, or you may use images that mean something to you.
- [ ]  Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [ ]  A `My Projects` button (doesn't need to be functional)
- [ ]  A `Contact Me` button (doesn't need to be functional)

## Task 3: Stretch Goals

- [ ]  Add links to social media profiles (Instagram, linkedIn, Twitter) into the footer section of your home page.
- [ ]  Link navigation items to new HTML pages
- [ ]  Host your website on Netlify.com

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your project manager will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.
